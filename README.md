Vanilla Cookie Manager
==============

# DEPRECATED

> I haven't updated this extension in years, mostly because Google never provided a useful API to manage all your site data. Please look for alternatives.



A Cookie Whitelist Manager for Chrome that helps protect your privacy. Automatically removes unwanted cookies.
Cookies can be used for authentication, storing your site preferences or anything else that can be saved as text data. Unfortunately they can also be used to track you.

You could turn off cookies completely or just shut off third-party cookies. But that would also keep out useful cookies that many web apps rely upon to work (like Google Mail or Calendar).

With Vanilla you can select which cookies you want to keep on a whitelist. All unwanted cookies are deleted automatically (or manually if you prefer).


Local Storage
------------
Vanilla cannot manage local storage because Chrome has yet to implement an api for it.
